#Girl Develop It - JavaScript 201: Intro to jQuery
===================

Meet jQuery, a small, cross-browser JavaScript library that makes adding interactivity, creating animations, and manipulating the DOM easier. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library and has been used on some of the world's most popular websites. It's also included in some of the most popular CMS's including WordPress and Drupal.

We'll cover the basics: traversing web pages to find and manipulate elements; creating new elements and adding them to your page; listening and reacting to events; creating animations and effects; and following best practices for using jQuery. We'll have hands-on exercises throughout the workshop.
